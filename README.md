# Bank-Marketing-Analysis-project
Business Understanding
 as a business analytics consultant at hypothetical bank named  Bank of Corporate. The bank provides its customers with financial services, such as savings accounts, current accounts and debit cards. In order to increase its overall revenue, the bank conducts various marketing campaigns for its financial products, such as credit cards, term deposits and loans. These campaigns are intended for the bank’s existing customers. However, these campaigns need to be cost-efficient so that the bank increases its overall revenues and total profit. As a bank consultant, you need to apply your knowledge of EDA to the existing data to analyse patterns and provide solution for future marketing campaigns.
In 2017, the bank conducted a telemarketing campaign for one of its financial products, ‘term deposits’, to help foster long-term relationships with its existing customers. The data set (provided below) contains information about all customers who were contacted during this year to open term deposit accounts.

Business Objectives
 aim to identify the target customers for the term deposits from the pool of the bank’s existing customers. You should also capture the key driving factors (or driver variables) behind the successful conversion of a customer, i.e., the customer opening a term deposit account with the bank. 
 
 Results Expected
The following pointers must be addressed before submitting the project:

Provide a step-by-step approach and details of the analyses performed to derive the insights in a PowerPoint presentation.
Identify the missing data, duplicate data, outliers and spelling inconsistencies; use the appropriate methods to deal with these issues.
Identify the possible derived columns. If required, convert any specific column to a required format for easy analysis.
Explain the results of univariate, segmented univariate, bivariate analyses, etc., in business terms. In addition, identify the insights that will explain how a specific variable plays an important role in influencing the customers to open the term deposit account with the bank.
Include visualisations and summarise the most important results in the presentation. You can choose the graphs that explain the numerical/categorical variables.
Derive the required values based on EDA of the data set for future marketing campaigns.
